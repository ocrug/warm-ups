# Warm-ups

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository are "warm-up" guides we like to
use at the beginning of certain OCRUG meetings to introduce R beginners
to R through hands-on immersion with basic concepts.  They are intended
to run for about 15 - 20 minutes.  These notebooks themselves are meant
as a sort of presenter's guide.  The idea is that the presenter will
simply present their R command prompt while participants follow on their
own machines.  The notebooks provide commands and explanations to follow
in the absence of tangents.  But spontaneous tangents are always welcome.
There is no deadlines or schedules.

## Available Topics

* [Distributions](distributions/) - These notebooks use the
  investigation of basic concepts of probability distributions as a means
  to exercise R commands for sampling, plotting, and working with vectors.

* [Split-Apply-Combine](sac/) - These notebooks run through
  short scenarios on basic split-apply-combine topics.
