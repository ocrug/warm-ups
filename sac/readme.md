Split-Apply-Combine
-------------------

These notebooks introduce split-apply-combine topics by applying
basic commands to datasets included with R.

* __sac1-factors__ - Factor variables are introduced along with
  functions that operate on them such as `levels`, `table`,
  `xtabs`, and `aggregate`.  The `ChickWeight` dataset is used
  to demonstrate.

* __sac2-factors__ - Methods for creating new factor variables
  to fit a *split* criteria are explored.
